## RoundyFi
### RoundyFi is a round LCD display based on ESP-12E along with a compact and stylish 1.28-inch display module of 240×240 resolution, 65K RGB colors, clear and colorful displaying effect, expand its engagement with your project. RoundyFi comes with an embedded GC9A01 Driver and SPI Interface that minimize the required IO pins.

See there is a folder name RoundyFi, inside this folder, there are various applications:-
  * **Display Weather** -> Display the current weather via the "OpenWeatherMap" website, first of all, you need to make an account in OpenWeatherMap
    https://openweathermap.org/api and copy the API key and paste in the code, 
    Download the Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
    There are also various libraries you need to install, we mention the libraries in a text file, which is inside the folder

  * **Make Server**  -> Make server using RoundyFi. There are also various libraries you need to install, we mention the libraries in a text file, which is inside the folder.
    From this, we can communicate between server and client. for example, we make the mobile phone a client and RoundyFi as a server

See there is a folder name RoundyPi, inside this folder, there are various applications:-
In this device we use Micropython and Circuit python(Adafruit Industries) both 

  * **Connect Air Monitoring Sensor** -> (Use Micropython) We add the four GP pins for Input/Output devices(GP0,GP1,GP2,GP3).For example We connect Air monitoring breakout,you       need to save this file "pmsa003.py" in the pico, this is the library of air monitor sensor. and for round lcd you need to drag and drop the round lcd firmware "firmware.uf2" 
  * **Display Images** -> 
  * **Memory card reader** ->
